# Jos√© Quinto Blog

This is the source code for my blog [blog.josequinto.com](https://blog.josequinto.com). 

These are some interesting features:
- [Hexo](https://hexo.io) to generate static pages.
- [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com) as a platform to search posts.
- My own theme customized based on [hexo-theme-melody](https://github.com/Molunerfinn/hexo-theme-melody).
- It is hosted as GitHub pages and served with a custom domain using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

## Install

After cloning the project, install the `npm` dependencies and `Hexo`:

`$ npm i && npm i hexo -g`

## Develop

`$ npm run dev`

Then open http://localhost:4000/ in a browser.

## Deploy

`$ npm run deploy`
