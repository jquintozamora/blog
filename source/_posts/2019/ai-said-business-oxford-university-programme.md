One of my **professional goals for 2019** was to study something related with **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. 🤖

As part of my innovation skills **I already have knowledge and expertise designing and implementing voice apps and bots** 🗣 ( which is another type of AI), but I wanted to learn also **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**. 🤪

During my search for something to study in an online manner, an advertisement came up with [Oxford Artificial intelligence Programme 2019](https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/programmes/oxford-artificial-intelligence-programme) and that was ideal for me because allowed me study online but also comes from a high recognized University and Business School: [Oxford Saïd](https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/) 🔝. So, exciting times, I decided to *invest* in my skills and enroll into that programme.

## The approach and graduation process
In my opinion, one of the **challenges** for success on the programme is the fact that most of students are **working and studying at the same time**, so the combination of **flexibility** and also **achievable deadlines** is important. Also a good structure in terms of independent units for every module. 👍
In terms of approach, I liked the approach of having **graded activities at the end of each module**. Also, I liked having a **forum platform in which all students discuss further any topics** and share different experiences in different sectors.
In terms of professors, I liked the **professors were actively involved** in our discussions and gave proactive feedback after every module.
I'd definitely recommend that / or similar online programmes.

## Final Grades

I **completed** the program in **July 2019** 👨🏻‍💻 with a score of **81 out of 100** 🤓, I am proud of it due to the high average level in the class. 🚀

## Next Steps
After that course of AI and ML, **I do have a better overall on Machine Learning and its applications in real life**.

My next steps towards AI skills are potentially: **advanced Machine Learning course** and **side projects to grown my ML skills**. 💪🏻🤖
