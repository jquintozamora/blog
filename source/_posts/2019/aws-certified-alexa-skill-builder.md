Back in January 2019, **Amazon** launched beta exams for **AWS Certification Alexa Skill Builder - Specialty**. Then I signed up to keep up my Alexa Skills knowledge. Previously, I worked designing and implementing the [Eurostar Skill for Alexa](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eurostar/dp/B07K8RVXF7) during 6 months as par of the **Innovation Team** at **Eurostar**. It was quite intense project and at the same time exciting to work in that new technology in collaboration with Amazon Team in London. I learnt a lot, so I was looking forward to put all that learning into a certification. 

Today, I've received an email from Amazon with the good news! 

I'm happy to announce I've become `AWS Alexa Skill Builder Certified`!
