Iâ€™d like to share a quick solution which always is really useful when you are handling complex object-type data structures in JavaScript / ES6 / TypeScript. 

That code will be useful when you want to extract some property values from an array of objects.

I will share two versions one for EcmaScript 5 and other for EcmaScript 6:
