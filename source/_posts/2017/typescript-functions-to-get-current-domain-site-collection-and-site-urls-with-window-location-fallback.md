##Â Introduction
Recently, I was working in a **TypeScript** project building a SPA application on top of Office 365 and I needed to get the current domain, current site collection and current site urls for using them in a different React components.

The case is we always rely on **_spPageContextInfo** to get this information, but in fact, we can use window.location object to build the urls as a fallback in case we need to use this Utils library before SP.js loaded or in other context.

## Code
Here is my solution for that problem using TypeScript:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/jquintozamora/aa3b10c08270385acaed0374cf00475a.js"></script>
