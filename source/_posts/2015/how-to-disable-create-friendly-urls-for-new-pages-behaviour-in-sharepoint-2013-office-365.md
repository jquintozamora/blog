## Introduction
I was trying to apply a filter in a `Search Result Web Part` in order to display items that match only with a specific content type and belonging to a specific sub site. 
It was annoying to me that the property `Path` neither the property `ParentLink` worked as expected. As many times, the search engine just returned 0 results.

This was the filter used in Query Tool: `Path:{Site.URL}`

Talking with my friend [Ben](https://twitter.com/BenCernuda) about the scenario we are trying to figure out why. Finally we noticed that OOB in SharePoint, when create a new `Publishing Site Collection` or `Enterprise Wiki Site Collection` (or custom WT inheriting in these), automatically the Manage Navigation is configured and with this one "Create friendly URLs for new pages automatically" option.

## SPO Navigation settings
Navigation by default enables the options:

So, If you are in the scenario in which you need to do some filter using Site-scoped pages or do you prefer not enable the friendly urls in your sites, then you should disable the Create friendly urls option.  

## Is possible to solve declaratively?
For now, there is no way to solve this in a **declarative way** (using **XML** files or **Onet.xml** configuration). So, to solve that we are going to apply some **JSOM (JavaScript)** code to configure it accordingly.  

We should use this object in JSOM classes:  > 
`SP.Publishing.Navigation.WebNavigationSettings`: [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj994744.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj994744.aspx)  

The exact method is `SP.Publishing.Navigation.WebNavigationSettings.set_createFriendlyUrlsForNewPages(value)`

##Â Code
This is the code to disable the **Create Friendly URLs** for New Pages behavior:
