You might not know at first whether you’re using Excel Online (in the cloud), Excel Services (on premises), or Excel Web App (on premises) to view and interact with a workbook in a browser window. Fortunately, there are some easy ways to find out.<p>If you’re signing into Office 365<a name="_GoBack"></a>, you’re using Excel Online. <p>If you’re using SharePoint Server 2013 (on premises), one good way to determine whether you’re using Excel Services or Excel Web App is to examine the website address (URL) for the workbook:

*   If the URL resembles “http://[servername]_layouts/15/xlviewer.aspx?id=/Documents/...” then Excel Services is used to render the workbook.<li>If the URL resembles “http://[servername]/_layouts/15/WopiFrame2.aspx?sourcedoc=/Documents/...” then Excel Web App is used to render the workbook.<p>&nbsp;
