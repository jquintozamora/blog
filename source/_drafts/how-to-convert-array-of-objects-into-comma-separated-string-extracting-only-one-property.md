Hi,

Iâ€™d like to share a quick solution which always is really useful when you are handling complex object-type data structures in JavaScript / ES6 / TypeScript. 

That code will be useful when you want to extract some property values from an array of objects.

I will share two versions one for EcmaScript 5 and other for EcmaScript 6:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/jquintozamora/4d0069b50b457b677d1077ca7e803936.js"></script> 

If you find other way to do the same with a better performance, please let me know!!

Enjoy!
