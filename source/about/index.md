## Software Engineer ~ José Quinto
Hello, my name is **José Quinto**, I'm **Software Engineer** (currently focused on `Web Development` and `Voice Systems`). I consider myself a **lucky** person as I work everyday building amazing stuff and changing the way in which the world works. 

Originally I'm from **Albatera**, a little town from **Spain**.

As part of my hobbies I'm interested on `Artificial Intelligence`, `Machine Learning`, and `D3.js`. 

Also, I like cycling and playing football, and I've got some skills for cooking `spanish omelette`.
  
Currently I'm working (*Contract*) as a `Software Engineer - Full Stack JavaScript Developer` at **Eurostar** in London, United Kingdom.
